# Road Segmentation Using UNET with PyTorch

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing road segmentation using the U-Net architecture with PyTorch. Leveraging a labeled dataset, the U-Net model will be trained to accurately distinguish road and non-road areas in images. The architecture's contracting and expansive paths enable effective pixel-level segmentation.Future enhancements may involve fine-tuning for specific environments and integration with dynamic video feeds.

## Project Description

TThis project focuses on implementing a road segmentation model using PyTorch and the U-Net architecture. The model will be trained on a labeled dataset to distinguish road and non-road areas in images. Deployment aims to provide real-time road segmentation on new images, with potential enhancements including fine-tuning for specific environments and integration with dynamic video feeds.
